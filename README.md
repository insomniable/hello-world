# hello-world
Following the introduction

My name is Andy and I am a first year engineering student. I'm learning GitHub and Git so I can have better control over my projects.
I know Python and C, LaTeX and some Matlab. I hope to improve my knowledge of these, and learn more tools and languages that can be helpful to me.
